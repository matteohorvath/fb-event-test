# fb-event-test

## Description

The `fb-event-test` program is designed to interact with Facebook events. It allows users to access and manage event data from Facebook pages. This tool is particularly useful for users who need to gather information about events they are interested in or are managing.

## Limitations

- The program can only access Facebook pages that the user is logged into or has permission to access. This means that any pages or events that require specific user permissions or are private will not be accessible unless the user has the necessary credentials.
